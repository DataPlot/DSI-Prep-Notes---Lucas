_Scaffold of the Technical Interview_
Warm Up
The Warm Up includes fairly simple functions, generally regarding sampling and simple probability calculations.
* 3-6 functions
* 3-6 Conceptual Questions re: Probability/Statistics
    * Know your basic statistics and metrics (for Populations and Sample)
        * Mean
        * Median
        * Mode
        * Variance/Standard Deviation
        * Mean Squared Error
        * Mean Absolute Error
        * Z-score/Normal Distr methods 
    * Understand the Law of Total Probability
    * Understand and Perform problems related to Bayes Theorem

Main Problem
The Main Problem usually includes extending the simpler functions you wrote in the warm up. Although it is a bonus to memorize the PMFs and PDFs of these distributions, it is not necessary. We will provide formulas when necessary. Most people do not complete all challenges in the Main Problem, but don't worry about that. We do not expect you to complete all problems in the TI.

Know how to write Dictionaries that explore sampling from or representing these common distributions: * Bernoulli 
Bernoulli 
* Binomial  
* Poisson  
* Exponential 
* Normal
